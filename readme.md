A practical evaluation method should be convenient (i.e., parameter-free), efficient (i.e., fewer iterations) and reliable (i.e., approaching the lower bound of robustness). Towards this target, we propose a parameter-free **Adaptive Auto Attack** (A3) evaluation method. We apply A3 to nearly 50 widely-used defense models. By consuming much fewer iterations than existing methods, i.e, 1/10 on average (10x speed up), we achieve lower robust accuracy in all cases. Notably, we won first place out of 1681 teams in CVPR 2021 White-box Adversarial Attacks on Defense Models competitions with this method.

**Code will be released soon**
